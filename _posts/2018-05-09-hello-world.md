Look at this! I've successfully created a blog using Jekyll!

I'm Bethany and I just began my full-time journey into web development last week! I'm super
excited to use this blog as a way to track my progress and delve deeper into the development community!

Prior to leaving my job to study web development full-time,
 I dabbled a bit in web development and I've been most interested in backend work. I
attended RailsBridge in North Carolina in February 2018 and really loved working with Ruby on Rails. Since most of limited experience
has been using backend languages and I've had very little exposure to designing a decent looking site, I decided
to spend my first couple of weeks working through HTML and CSS. I'm amazed at how quickly you can take a site from
looking like 1997 to looking AMAZING with a little bit of CSS. I used the udemy course "Build Responsive
Real World Websites with HTML5 and CSS3" and was really impressed with the content and teaching style! By the end of the
course you have been walked through the creation of a fairly impressive looking website - if you learn mostly by
doing, I would highly recommend this class! Additionally I've been referencing Jon Duckett's "HTML&CSS:design and build websites" for clarification on concepts that were used but not expanded on in the udemy course (i.e. margins vs. padding).

I began work on the 'codosaur' site which is going to become my main hub for my blog, portfolio, ect. I was really excited to be able to find some ridiculous toy dinosaur photos from unsplash
to give my site more personality.

Though my skills are not quite to the point where I am able to begin dev work, I started working through
the early plans for a big personal project called shelterly. I am aiming to create an open source animal
sheltering database to be able to combine my skills and knowledge from my former career in animal welfare
with my soon to be new career in web development. I'll be sure to update as more happens with shelterly!

This week I'm planning on building a simple HTML/CSS site for Gray Acre Hops as something to include in
my portfolio to show the skills I've learned so far as well as continuing to make changes to codosaur.
